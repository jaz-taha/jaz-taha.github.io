IEEE ENIM SB and its officers responded for the call of their colleagues and future fellow IEEE members in ISIMM University (Higher Institute of Mathematics and Comupter Science).
	We conducted several info sessions that contained a general presentation of the IEEE and its enormous impact worldwide. We shaded the light on the the benefits that the students will have after joinning the IEEE and how enhancing and an unbelievable experience they will have throughout their future activities within their new Student Branch.
	The general presentation contained facts (numbers and figures) about the IEEE as well as milestone events, competitions and platforms such as the IEEE Xtreme, the HAC and the IEEE Xplore. We also presented events and general meeting such as the IEEE Tunisian Students And Young Professionals Congress. We invited future ISIMM SB members to join us in our weekly meetings at the National Engineering School of Monastir (ENIM) to have an idea about how to kickstart their adventures.
	We will be working alongside the IEEE ISIMM Student Branch in the next period so they can get more and more familiar with the IEEE and they unlock the fact that they made the right choice!</p>
